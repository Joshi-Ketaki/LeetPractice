This repository is a record of my personal coding sessions.
The different branches have different types or patterns of coding problems:
1. Master and custom_memory_management_implementations: Memory management (malloc, calloc, realloc, free, memcpy implementations)
2. Dynamic Programming (DP)
3. Linked Lists
4. Backtracking
5. Graphs
6. Trees
