This repository is a record of my personal coding sessions. I log the different coding challenges or problems that I solve using Leetcode or my implementations of memory management operations here.

## Structure of the Repository:

The repository has multiple branches. Each branch is maintained for particular coding pattern or by the dominant data structure used in the problems solved there.
The different branches have different patterns of coding problems:
1. Master and custom_memory_management_implementations: My implementaion of Memory management operations (malloc, calloc, realloc, free, memcpy implementations)
2. Dynamic Programming (DP) : The DDP coding patterns.
3. Concurrency: Problems that solve for mutithreading.
4. 
Data Structures:
5. Linked Lists
6. Backtracking
7. Graphs
8. Trees

Misc:
1.high_frequency: Some commonly seen coding patterns.

## Structure of the Files:
Each file has the question written in comments followed by my implementation of the solution along with a few notes.
Note that as these are quick coded solutions with focus mainly on the underlying intuition, some of the examples may not have checks such as asserts for some conditions etc. explicitly added. If you refer to or use these solutions, make sure you actually add these checks when you implement something.
